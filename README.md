# Sports-Data-Management-System


## Overview
This project is a **MySQL relational database** designed to manage real-world sports data efficiently and accurately. The database is fully normalized (14 tables) to reduce redundancy and ensure **data integrity**.  

Key features include:  
- 14 **normalized tables** representing various entities in sports data.  
- Implementation of **4 data validation rules** to maintain data quality.  
- **100% data accuracy** across all tables with **referential integrity** enforced.  
- Insertion of **1000+ records** for realistic testing and simulation.  
- Optimized database design for **efficient data retrieval and write operations**.

## Database Structure

The database models real-world sports data, including entities such as:  
- Players  
- Teams  
- Matches  
- Leagues  
- Statistics  
- Venues  
- Coaches  
- Sponsors  
- And more  

All tables are linked with **foreign keys** to maintain relationships and ensure consistency.

## Validation Rules

The following data validation rules are implemented to maintain integrity:  
1. **Primary Key Uniqueness** – Each table has a unique identifier.  
2. **Foreign Key Constraints** – Ensures relational consistency across tables.  
3. **Data Type Validation** – Columns accept only valid data types (e.g., dates, numbers).  
4. **Domain Constraints** – Certain fields restricted to predefined values (e.g., team status, match type).
